                    Windows 8 or newer<br/>
                    Java 8 or a newer version installed<br/>
                    at least 4GB of RAM (for optimal performance)</i>
                </p>
                <p style="display: inline-block; margin-top: -10px">Waterworks is a game intended to teach children ages 8 to 10 about the dangers of water overuse, and strategies to prevent it. The game consists of three different rooms. The first room teaches you to identify water efficient and water inefficient devices as well as various solutions for water overuse. The second room allows you to test your knowledge on which devices are water efficient, and which water ineffecient. The last room consists of a game where you jump accross 1 of 3 lakes to turn of a water inefficient device draining the water, whilst dodging other inefficient devices, and using efficient ones.</p>
