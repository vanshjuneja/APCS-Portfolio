                <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
                <p>
                    Polymorphism is the system that allows an object to act the part of many different datatypes, ranging from it's own class, all the way up to it's highest-level Object superclass, and everything in between. An Object can be cast up from its own class, but not down. This is because a subclass is it's superclass, but a superclass is not necssarily a specific one of its subclass. This is similat to how all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares.

                <p>
                    Java makes a decision on which method within a class hierarchy should be executed based on a polymorphic system called binding. This is determined by the object type, not the object reference.

                <h3>Static and Dynamic Binding
                </h3>
                <p id="p">
                    <b>Dynamic Binding:</b>
                    <br/>
                    The overloading of a method between a superclass and subclass in polymorphism. Java’s compiler dynamically decides the correct method to be executed based on the object type and method arguments.
                </p>
                <p id="p">
                    <b>Static Binding:</b>
                    <br/>
                    Also known as early binding, static binding is the overloading of a method within the same class. It is static because the method call is “hard-coded” meaning that it will always accord with one of the overloaded methods.
