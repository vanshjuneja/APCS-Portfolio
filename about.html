                <h2>Personality Type -- Who Am I?</h2>
                <section>
                    <img src="images/entj.jpg" style="align-self: center;"/>

                <p>
                    This personality type stands for extroverted, intuitive, thinking, and judging. This personality type is known for being up-front yet charismatic in behaviour. Often times the charisma is rooted in strong leadership and independence through thorough, tedious planning. Cleverness and good story-telling abilities means that ENTJs have outstanding salesmanship, which combined with their leadership skills makes them optimal candidates for entrepreneurship. Despite being inclined to creative problem solving, strict adherence to some fundamental principles or code remains essential to this group, moral or otherwise. Because they have such a strong hold on reality, they can be prone to manipulating it in order to satisfy their worldview when conversing with others. ENTJs are likely to support a centralization of power in the form of hierarchical structures. As a result a large portion of CEOs, politicians, and other leaders are of the ENTJ personality type. It’s also no surprise that they have a knack for healthy debate and discussion where they can put their extroversion, intuition, thinking, and judgement to work all at once.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Career-wise, ENTJs commonly go into fields involving critical thinking, intellect, organization, and room for creativity or innovation. Specific fields include management positions (business management, education management, politics), legal services (law, counseling), and technology/science (engineering, computer science).
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    ENTJs have a very easy time grasping on to abstract and theoretical concepts. They enjoy contemplating existential thought, while also being interested in practical/real-world solutions to problems. Though able to exercise mechanical memorization, they find it to require drastically less effort to memorize through deeper understanding of concepts. Memorizing vastly differing unassociated terms is especially mentally straining for this personality type. It is similarly straining if the material is of no particular interest to him/her.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    ENTJs can sometimes come off as bossy or judgemental, but they simply have a drive to act in accordance with a set of rules to maintain law and order. Their “judginess” does not come from a bad place either. It is just an adverse effect of being direct/straight-forward with people.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I found the descriptions and specifics of this personality type to be surprisingly accurate to myself and my abilities. Though I identify with the vast majority of the ENTJ brand, I would have to agree that it is most-likely a combination of the placebo effect and luck. The entire Myers-Brigs test is conconted on a series of provenly-false theories and has no bearing on modern psychological analysis as a result. The only reason it is still used is because everyone wins. Nobody is told a hard truth or something that can’t be argued true for anyone.
